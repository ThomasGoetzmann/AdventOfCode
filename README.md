# Advent of Code

This is my attempt to participate in the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2019 in [F#](https://fsharp.org/).

I am still learning F# and functional programming. 

The code will probably need some serious improvement.
(Thanks to [CameronAavik](https://github.com/CameronAavik/AdventOfCode) and [ChrisPritchard](https://github.com/ChrisPritchard/AdventOfCode). Their code helped me understand F# better and progress.)
